## Mango

A centralized system for HR Outsourcing companies. *Mango* allows outsourcing teams to improve their workflow, and increase their productivity,<br>
by streamlining the bulk of hiring process tasks, thus allowing consultants and managers to focus on matching candidates with companies.<br>
Through the use of our mobile client, applicants can apply to specific job postings and monitor the progress of their request (sheduled interviews,<br>
tests, notifications). 

_*Final deliverable for CN 7021*_
